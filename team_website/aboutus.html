                I come to RIT from Massachusetts, and have just returned from my data engineering co-op at ADUSA last spring.  
                While in Rochester, I stay involved at Roc City Circus, doing primarily flying trapeze and performing in shows 
                throughout the year (come see our horror show Post Mortem, Nov. 7-8th!)  This project caught my attention in part 
                due to taking ASL classes for my immersion, which gave me a great opportunity to learn more about the Deaf 
                community in Rochester and beyond.

                Hey, I'm Lyn! I'm from Massachusetts. I have completed two co-ops in security systems with LenelS2 (part of 
                Honeywell) and Keenfinity, as well as a third co-op in vulnerability research with RIT's own Andy Meneely and 
                Brandon Keller. When I'm not doing homework, you can find me swinging a sword with RIT HEMA (Historical 
                European Martial Arts), crocheting, or playing video games. I'm always excited to make the world a better 
                place for everyone in it, and I hope this project can increase the accessibility of a popular community!

                    I am a fourth year software engineering major from Pittsburgh, PA. My co-ops have been in a wide range of 
                    fields from doing embedded software coding coffee machines with Keurig Dr Pepper to supporting the Air Force 
                    Research Laboratory's Quantum Photonic Semiconductor Team, automating their chip probing equipment. I spent 
                    a semester working on AI-augmented building access tools as a data science and machine learning co-op 
                    with Honeywell, and a summer working on advanced robotics in a combined engineering role with Sig Sauer.

                    Outside of my academics, I've participated on a variety of activites including the RIT Club Sailing Team, 
                    Intercollegiate Quizbowl Team, Bartending for RIT Catering, Greek Life, Jewish Life, and, for this year, 
                    also being a part of RITs Student Government. I'm really looking forward to supporting this project, the 
                    increasing accessibility it provides to users, as well as the platform's embedded systems and networking 
                    requirements.

                Hi, my name is Thomas Garcia and I'm from Yonkers, NY. I'm returning from my Database Administration internship 
                to finish my final year here at RIT!  In my free time, I like going out with my girlfriend to bar hop and try 
                new drinks and I enjoy playing FPS and MOBA games with friends. I'm a big soccer fan and anything 
                horror/supernatural related, and I'd like to get back into reading more. I'm excited to be working on this project 
                since it's a great chance to apply what I've learned and create something meaningful for people!
