        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            Our projectâ€™s goal is to continue developing a radio based train tracking web application designed for deaf users, 
            more specifically deaf railfans. Our application aims to provide reliable, user friendly, real time train location 
            information for the deaf railfan community as no solution adequately exists for this. Currently, users rely on 
            methods such as online forums or physically waiting near tracks, which are not unreliable, especially as some train 
            signals are relocated to inaccessible areas. The core functionality of this application converts EOT, HOT, and DPU 
            signal data into an accessible visual interface (website), allowing users to monitor train locations and statuses 
            with ease. If time permits, development on stretch features such as, creating an IOS and Android application, 
            adding a live camera feed along monitored train routes, and more. With proper information processing alongside 
            an ADA compliant interface, our project offers an inclusive solution that meets the needs of deaf rail enthusiasts.

        <h2>A Message From Our Sponsor</h2>
        <p>
            My grandfather worked for Erie Lackawanna RR. He always took me to the yard for rides in the yard or on local trains 
            to serve customers on the line. Since then, I have always enjoyed watching trains go by to keep memories of my 
            grandfather. My inspiration for this project is to able know where the trains are, in the same way hearing people can 
            use their radios. This project will help to overcome the barrier. I hope this will become successful within the 
            railfan community, especially for other deaf railfans. Hopefully this will also expand out to other states.
